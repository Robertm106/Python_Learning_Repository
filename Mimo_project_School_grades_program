# The maximum grade for each subject is 100. So,
# the total maximum grade a student can obtain is 400. With this information,
# let's calculate Sam's total grade as a percentage.

# Create a max_grade variable and assign the number 400 to it.
# Create a total_percentage variable that stores Sam's grades in percentage. #
# You can calculate the percentage by dividing the total grade that Sam achieved by the maximum grade and multiplying the result by 100.
# Print a statement that reads: "Sam's total percentage is <total>%". Replace with the total_percentage variable.


student_name = "Sam"
math_grade = 88
science_grade = 75
english_grade = 90
geology_grade = 69
total_grade = math_grade + science_grade + english_grade + geology_grade
max_grade = 400
total_percentage = total_grade / max_grade * 100
print(f"Sam's total percentage is {total_percentage}%")

# Awesome! We receive word from the IT department in the school that the system they work with doesn't accept decimals.
# #To ensure we only display the total percentage with integers,
# we need to convert the total_percentage from a float to an integer.

total_percentage = int(total_percentage)


#Using the information we just obtained, let's check if Sam passed the semester. 
# #The course instructor informs us that in order for a student to pass, 
# #they must score a total percentage of 50 or higher.

did_student_pass = 50 >= total_percentage

#As we process Sam's report, we notice that Sam never participated in any sporting activities at school. 
#Hence, Sam will get a 0 in sports. 
# #This is an extra-curricular activity, #
# so Sam's grades will not be affected. 
# #However, we want to reflect this information in the report.a

sporting_activities = bool(0)
print(f"Sam participated in sporting activities: {sporting_activities}")

#Using f-strings, print the following:
#A statement that reads: Sam's total percentage as an integer is <percentage>%. Replace <percentage> with the total_percentage variable.
#A statement that reads: Sam passed to the next semester: <boolean>. Replace <boolean> by the did_student_pass variable.

print(f"Sam participated in sporting activities: {sporting_activities}")
print(f"Sam's total percentage as an integer is {total_percentage}%")
print(f"Sam passed to the next semester: {did_student_pass}")

#Now, try tinkering with this project as you like. You may try the following:

#Create variables that hold information about other subjects.
#Calculate and print the average grade.
#Compare subjects' grades together and print information on which one has higher grades.
#Have fun exploring!
